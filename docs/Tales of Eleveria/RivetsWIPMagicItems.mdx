# Rivet's Workshop Prototypes

*Experimental magical items seeking approval and refinement*

## Introduction

This workshop catalog documents magical items still in the conceptual or prototype stage. Each entry represents a potential innovation that Rivet is seeking feedback on, materials for, or approval to develop. These items exist primarily as sketches, theoretical models, or early prototypes not yet ready for practical application.

:::note Collaboration Invited
Fellow Zululu members and esteemed Dungeon Master: Your feedback is essential to refining these concepts! Comments, suggestions, and balance considerations are welcomed and encouraged.

## Prototype Details

### Drunken Echo Wraps

**Intended Rarity:** Very Rare
**Attunement:** *(requires attunement by a Monk)*  
**Development Phase:** Theoretical  
**Materials Needed:** 
- TBD

#### Concept Description
These lightweight handwraps shimmer with a copper-green sheen, etched with faintly glowing monk kanji representing "*flow*," "*echo*," and "*balance*." When Gio moves, the wraps emit faint chimes like ceramic wind bells; each note syncing with his motion in harmony. Rivet's signature is etched inside one cuff: "For G - Never miss a beat."

#### Proposed Features
##### Echo Momentum
When you use *Step of the Wind* or *Patient Defense*, you gain +1 AC until the start of your next turn. Additionally, your next unarmed strike before the end of your turn has advantage.
##### Radiant Slipstream
Once per short rest, when you take the *Dodge* action, you can activate a burst of divine reflexes:
    * You gain the effects of Sanctuary (DC 16) until the start of your next turn.
    * You can immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
##### Necroflux Mesh
While concentrating on a spell or benefiting from a buff that affects allies (*e.g., Bless, Heroism, Aid*), you gain resistance to necrotic damage.

#### Questions from Gio / Blaze
* TBD

#### Questions for DM
* TBD

### Resonance Disruptor

**Intended Rarity:** Rare  
**Attunement:** Not Required  
**Development Phase:** Early Prototype  
**Materials Needed:**
- Phase Spider Silk
- Sonic Crystal
- Residuum (100gp worth)

#### Concept Description
A tuning fork-like device that, when activated, emits a specific frequency that temporarily disrupts the magical resonance of an area, making it difficult to maintain concentration on spells or sustain ongoing magical effects.

#### Proposed Mechanics
- As an action, activate the device to create a 20-foot radius sphere of disruption
- Creatures maintaining concentration on spells must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration
- Ongoing spell effects of 3rd level or lower are suppressed while in the area
- The device has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn

#### Questions for DM
1. Is the DC appropriate for the intended rarity?
2. Should the effect discriminate between allied and enemy spells?
3. Would this be better as a consumable item?
4. Are there existing magical items this might conflict with?

### Adaptive Camouflage Cloak

**Intended Rarity:** Uncommon  
**Attunement:** Required  
**Development Phase:** Sketching  
**Materials Needed:**
- Displacer Beast Hide
- Chameleon Scales
- Essence of Invisibility (extracted from Invisible Stalker)

#### Concept Description
A cloak that magically adapts to its surroundings, changing color and texture to match the environment. Unlike invisibility, it doesn't make the wearer completely unseen but rather helps them blend in seamlessly with their surroundings.

#### Proposed Mechanics
- Grants advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when not moving or moving at half speed
- As a bonus action, can enhance the effect for 10 minutes, making the wearer lightly obscured to creatures more than 10 feet away
- Enhanced effect can be used twice per long rest

#### Questions for DM
1. Would this stack too powerfully with rogue abilities?
2. Is the duration of the enhanced effect appropriate?
3. Should there be limitations based on environment type?
4. What challenges would be appropriate for acquiring a Displacer Beast hide? */}

## Development Process

Each prototype follows this development path:

1. **Conceptual Phase** - Initial idea and sketch
2. **Material Gathering** - Collection of necessary components
3. **DM Approval** - Review of mechanics and balance
4. **Prototype Construction** - Initial creation and testing
5. **Refinement** - Adjustment based on testing results
6. **Final Development** - Completion of the magical item

Items move from this prototyping catalog to the main Arcane Atelier catalog once fully developed and functional.
