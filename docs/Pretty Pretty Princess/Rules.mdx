## Objective 
Be the first player to have the crown, a full matching jewelry set â€” **and** complete a Royal Decree without wearing the dreaded Clear Ring!

### Original Rules
Find the original rules to [Pretty Pretty Princess](https://winning-moves.com/images/PPPrincess_RulesV2.pdf) here

### SET UP
1. Same basic setup with jewelry and crown.
2. Shuffle the "Royal Decrees" deck (silly, wholesome mini-challenges).

### HOW TO PLAY
- On your turn, spin and move your pawn.
- Follow the [original space rules](#original-rules), with a few fun upgrades

### NEW BOARD SPACES & RULES
**Jewelry Spaces**
- Same as original - take a matching jewelry piece if you don't already have it!

**Crown Space**
- Take the crown! Bow / Curtsey to your court (your friends) when you put it on.

**Clear Ring Space**
- You must wear the Clear Ring.
- Draw a **Royal Decree** card and complete it.
    - If you succeed, you get to hand the Clear Ring to another player!
    - If you decline or fail, keep the Clear Ring and place a piece of Jewlery back

**Put One Back Space**
- If you have the Clear Ring, you _must_ get rid of it before doing anything else
- If you don't have the Clear Ring, you must return a piece of jewelry.
- After completing the action, make a "Royal Proclamation" (e.g., "From now on, everyone must laugh after they speak" until your next turn).

**Take Any Piece Space**
- Choose one jewelry piece from the pile or steal one from another player.
- If you steal, you must deliver a royal "Thank You" speech (even if it's super exaggerated and silly).

### Royal Decrees
located in [./Royal Decrees](./Royal%20Decrees.mdx)

### THE FINAL CHALLENGE: WINNING THE GAME
Once you have:
- All your jewelry,
- The Crown,
- _No_ Black Ring...
You must draw and complete **one final Royal Decree** to be crowned the Pretty Pretty Princess!  
Your friends must give you a _Royal Applause_ when you succeed.

### BONUS OPTIONAL RULES (for more fun!)
- **Royal Compliments:**  
    During the game, if someone does something especially funny or kind, anyone can award them a Royal Compliment card (like "Best Sparkle" or "Queen of Sass"). No gameplay bonus, just good vibes!
- **Court Jester Rule:**  
    Whoever has the Black Ring is automatically the "Court Jester" and must end each sentence with a giggle or curtsy until they lose the ring.
- **Photograph the Royal Court:**  
    Take a group photo when the Pretty Pretty Princess is crowned, wearing their full set!
