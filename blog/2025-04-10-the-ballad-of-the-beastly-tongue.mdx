Notes:

(assume that no comment on specific lines means I like it)

After re-reading this, I dont really enjoy this. I'd like to either revert this or re-work it. Kinda forgot that we touch on Lead / Led later on. It also feels a bit redundant and the last couple lines are weak.


```md
> The *"O-U-G-H"* is tough... as well as "dough." \
> Then "cough" and "bough" put on a show. \
> You **plough** ahead, then hit a wall— \
> And stumble into "thorough" bawl.
```
This troublesome stanza again. Perhaps we cut this out and try something new entirely? Something else with the same sentiment on the inconsistencies of english perhaps?

```md
> In England's foggy, greenish clime, \
> A child once dared to question time: \
> "Is it "two' as in the clock I see, \
> Or "too' like 'also'—which should it be?"
```
This isn't a bad line, but I think it could be better. I like the idea of "two" and "too" being used in the same line, but I think it could be more clever. 

```md
 The "-ough" is tough—and so is "dough," \
> It boughs and coughs and hiccoughs low. \
```

Is HIccoughs a word? I think it is, but I don't know. I like the idea of it, but I think it could be more clever. 


```md
You twist, you turn, you loop, you laugh— \
> You write one half, pronounce the half.
``` 
Love the cadance in the first line, but the second feels weak.


```md
> Yet still it sings, this rogue, unbound— \
> It breaks the fence and haunts the hound. \
> A pirate tongue with stolen sail, \
> That makes you weep and makes you wail.
```

Don't really love these lines. I dont think it adds much other than it feels like Glazing english, which I am trying to do the opposite.



Overall please be creative! I love the direction of this poem, but I think it could be more clever and fun. I think it could be a bit more playful and whimsical, while still being a bit dark and cynical. I think it could be a bit more clever and fun, while still being a bit dark and cynical.

I like this direction, however feels very redundant.


```md
> With Latin roots, the path is straight— \
> *Amicus*, *aqua*, conjugate. \
> But English? She's a kleptomaniac— \
> With French stuck in her syntax crack.
```
I LOVE calling English 'kleptomaniac' however the syntax crack feels a bit forced. I think it could be more clever.  

```md
> The "-ough” is rough... but also "dough,” \
> It **coughs**, then **boughs**, then **sloughs** below. \
> You **plough** a field, you **though** a thought— \
> And somehow none of this gets taught.
```
you "though" a thought? what? I do like the direction of this tho. 


```md
> You might read "read” as "red” or "reed,” \
> Depending on what tense you need. \
> The present's past, the past is pressed— \
> The spelling stays. The rules? Regressed.
```
Eh. I think this could be more clever. For example, we could use also use 'Lead / Led'. Also we can play off as 'Mislead'.
