<p>I didn't set out to write this piece.<br>
<!-- -->It came through me the way exhaustion does<br>
<!-- -->slow, quiet, and absolute.<br>
<!-- -->Like many, I've been watching the world lose her shape<br>
<!-- -->truth hollowed out, care turned into currency,<br>
<!-- -->and suffering dressed up as inevitability.</p>
<p>I kept seeing the same pattern,<br>
<!-- -->not just struggle, but design.<br>
<!-- -->A wheel doesn't spin by accident.<br>
<!-- -->It's built, maintained and greased with silence and fear.</p>
<p>This piece is an allegory,<br>
<!-- -->but it's also a journal.<br>
<!-- -->The devil in this story doesn't carry a pitchfork.<br>
<!-- -->He signs contracts. He smiles in debates.<br>
<!-- -->He thanks you for your labor<br>
<!-- -->and leaves you with just enough to keep you alive, yet tired.</p>
<p>I wrote this for those who feel the weight but can't always name it.<br>
<!-- -->This isn't a battle cry. It's a dirge for the living.<br>
<!-- -->Because pain is not the end of us.<br>
<!-- -->Because even ground-down voices can still hum.</p>
<p>And some songs<br>
<!-- -->are stronger than the wheel.</p>
<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>The earth was broken long ago,<br>
<!-- -->Before we knew her name.<br>
<!-- -->They carved the clouds into a brand,<br>
<!-- -->Then sold us skies of flame.</p>
<p>And still, the wheel turns round,<br>
<!-- -->Grinding bone and soil and sound.<br>
<!-- -->We cry, we bleed, we till the ground<br>
<!-- -->And still, the wheel turns round.</p>
<p>The healer's door is locked and cold,<br>
<!-- -->Its key a price too steep.<br>
<!-- -->The sick are told to wait in line—<br>
<!-- -->Or pay, or pray, or weep.</p>
<p>And still, the wheel turns round,<br>
<!-- -->Grinding bone and soil and sound.<br>
<!-- -->We cry, we bleed, we till the ground—<br>
<!-- -->And still, the wheel turns round.</p>
<p>The food is fake, the rent is real,<br>
<!-- -->The clocks all run in debt.<br>
<!-- -->We sell our breath to buy the means<br>
<!-- -->To sleep, forget, and sweat.</p>
<p>And still, the wheel turns round,<br>
<!-- -->Grinding bone and soil and sound.<br>
<!-- -->We cry, we bleed, we till the ground—<br>
<!-- -->And still, the wheel turns round.</p>
<p>The children learn to count in scars,<br>
<!-- -->The newsmen sell us blame.<br>
<!-- -->We know the world is burning down,<br>
<!-- -->But never name the flame.</p>
<p>And still, the wheel turns round,<br>
<!-- -->Grinding bone and soil and sound.<br>
<!-- -->We cry, we bleed, we till the ground—<br>
<!-- -->And still, the wheel turns round.</p>
<p>We are the cogs beneath the wheel,<br>
<!-- -->Our breath the grease that keeps it fed.<br>
<!-- -->It grinds us down, then pays in crumbs—<br>
<!-- -->Just enough to fear the dead.</p>
<p>It turns, it turns, it always has<br>
<!-- -->But every wheel runs thin.<br>
<!-- -->And one day soon, the steel will slip<br>
<!-- -->And let the fire in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>O Nick, brave bard of Baja Blast and burrito wrap,<br>
<!-- -->Our pajama-jeaned jester, our laugh-track and gap<br>
<!-- -->Burrito Baller turned Cloud Wrangler<br>
<!-- -->From beef wraps to backend stacks, you pivoted with swagger.</p>
<p>You take the roast like a king on his throne,<br>
<!-- -->Crowned in laughs, never standing alone.<br>
<em>"Just a lil guy"</em> we say with a smirk,<br>
<!-- -->But behind those wisecracks, there's a whole lotta work.</p>
<p>We watched you stammer, charm folded in fumble,<br>
<!-- -->As you asked for a "2 All Star Meal" and the cosmos crumbled.<br>
<!-- -->She blinked. You beamed. I wheezed like a kettle<br>
<!-- -->Moments like that? Pure comedic metal.</p>
<p>But beneath the facade and Baja blast mist,<br>
<!-- -->There's more to the man who we always missed<br>
<!-- -->When he's not around, the humor, yes<br>
<!-- -->But also that pulse of something less</p>
<p>something deeper, like sky behind smog.<br>
<!-- -->You left your job, and cleared the mental fog.<br>
<!-- -->Not everyone has the guts to say,<br>
<!-- -->"This thing that pays me? It chips me away."</p>
<p>So you walked. Not away-but toward.<br>
<!-- -->No confetti, no sword.<br>
<!-- -->Just resolve in your voice, and hands that shook<br>
<!-- -->Still, you turned the page. You rewrote the book.</p>
<p>You're our comic relief and the stillness between,<br>
<!-- -->The little brother wrapped in every scene.<br>
<!-- -->Two layers of pants, two sides you defend<br>
<!-- -->One for the laughs, one you're slow to lend.<br>
<!-- -->But we see you, Nick—not just what's shown,<br>
<!-- -->The quiet you carry, the strength you've grown.</p>
<p>So cheers, Nick. Our pajama knight,<br>
<!-- -->Still funny as hell, still full of fight.<br>
<!-- -->From burritos to backend, you've weathered the climb,<br>
<!-- -->You're not just part of the joke; you're the punchline's spine.</p>
<p>Here's to the courage you don't even boast,<br>
<!-- -->To the friend who we razz, but who matters the most.</p>
<p>Nick, you're the proof that soft souls are tough,<br>
<!-- -->And being real with yourself is more than enough.<br>
<!-- -->You're comedy stitched with a thread of gold<br>
<!-- -->The brother who's funny, and fierce, and bold.</p>

<p><strong>English is a mutt.</strong></p>
<p>She's a language that has been borrowed, stolen, and redefined so many times that it's hard to tell where it came from.
She's a patchwork quilt of cultures, histories, and sounds. She's a linguistic dumpster fire that somehow still manages to be beautiful.
Part Germanic growl, part Latin lace, with a touch of French flirtation, Viking vigor, and pure phonetic betrayal.</p>
<p>Welcome aboard the syntax spiral. <br>
<!-- -->Please stow your logic in the overhead bin.</p>
<!-- -->
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="owed-to-english-lexicon-of-lunacy"><em>Owed</em> to English, Lexicon of Lunacy<a href="https://leshicodes.github.io/blog/owed-to-english-lexicon-of-lunacy#owed-to-english-lexicon-of-lunacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to owed-to-english-lexicon-of-lunacy" title="Direct link to owed-to-english-lexicon-of-lunacy">​</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In England's green and foggy clime, <br>
<!-- -->A boy once dared to question time: <br>
<!-- -->"Is 'two' the one that ticks the clock, <br>
<!-- -->Or 'too' like 'also'—I'm in shock."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She said, "My dear, we spell by fate. <br>
<!-- -->A rule exists—until too late. <br>
<!-- -->A knight may know the gnat draws near, <br>
<!-- -->Yet neither <em><strong>K</strong></em> nor <em><strong>G</strong></em> you'll hear!"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some letters hide, some play pretend— <br>
<!-- -->Like “knife” and “gnat” and “psalm” and “friend.” <br>
<!-- -->You spell out “aisle” then walk right through— <br>
<!-- -->This language lies... but <em>sounds</em> like truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Chorus - strong, rhythmic cadence]</strong> <br>
<!-- -->Oh English, thou unruly beast, <br>
<!-- -->Where chaos reigns and rules have ceased. <br>
<!-- -->You spell with flair, pronounce with doubt— <br>
<!-- -->What's in is in, what's out stays out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He pondered "goose" and pondered "geese," <br>
<!-- -->Then asked aloud, "Why not some meese?" <br>
<!-- -->For "tooth" and "teeth" and "foot" and "feet"— <br>
<!-- -->Why moose and mice don't ever meet?</p>
<p>The past of "run" is simply "ran," <br>
<!-- -->But is it "span" or "spun," old man? <br>
<!-- -->You "sink" today but "sank" last week— <br>
<!-- -->Unless you're sunk in logic's leak.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Chorus - Sarcastic / Smirk]</strong> <br>
<!-- -->Oh English, thou eccentric fog, <br>
<!-- -->A barking sound, a spelling slog. <br>
<!-- -->You twist, you turn, you loop, you lurch— <br>
<!-- -->You light the match, then leave the church.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He met an ox, then oxen two, <br>
<!-- -->But boxes came from box (it's true!). <br>
<!-- -->A house becomes a bunch of "homes," <br>
<!-- -->Yet mouse gives mice, not plural "momes"!</p>
<p>With Latin roots, the path is straight— <br>
<em>Amicus</em>, <em>aqua</em>, conjugate. <br>
<!-- -->But English? She's a klepto-mage, <br>
<!-- -->Who pickpockets your mother tongue mid-page.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We steal from French, from Dutch, from Norse— <br>
<!-- -->Then twist their meanings, make them worse. <br>
<!-- -->A "gift" once killed, a "chef" once led— <br>
<!-- -->Now both just feed or bake your bread.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Chorus - Theatrical]</strong> <br>
<!-- -->Oh English, rogue of stolen skin, <br>
<!-- -->You wear the world, then twist the grin. <br>
<!-- -->A patchwork quilt of word and whim— <br>
<!-- -->Each syllable a prank in hymn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We hang the art, but men are hanged. <br>
<!-- -->A dream is dreamt—or maybe dreamed. <br>
<!-- -->You leap, you leapt... or maybe leaped— <br>
<!-- -->The rules are set, then rearranged.</p>
<p>Yet still it sings, this rogue of sound— <br>
<!-- -->Where stolen words are free to bound. <br>
<!-- -->It builds from chaos, rule by whim— <br>
<!-- -->A beast with jokes carved into limb.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Chorus - call-and-response, if done by two people]</strong> <br>
<!-- -->Oh English! — (What are you?) <br>
<!-- -->A sweet linguistic mess! <br>
<!-- -->We curse your rules, then acquiesce. <br>
<!-- -->We love the way you never stay— <br>
<!-- -->A shapeshift tongue that won't obey.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So curse it soft, or curse it loud, <br>
<!-- -->Then wear your spelling like a shroud. <br>
<!-- -->But love it still, this mongrel tongue— <br>
<!-- -->Whose battle with itself is sung.</p>
<p>Oh English, wild and wondrous wreck, <br>
<!-- -->A genius ship with holes on deck. <br>
<!-- -->A tragic joke, a syntax scream— <br>
<!-- -->The language of our fever dream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>English is a mutt.</p>
<p>She isn't fair. She's not consistent. She's not even particularly sane. But she is ours, in all her broken-glass beauty. Her absurdities give character. Her contradictions give punchlines. And her unpredictability? Well... that's half the fun, and most of the pain.</p>
<p>You may never pronounce "bough" or "slough" without second-guessing yourself again. But you'll know you're not alone. This ballad is for everyone who's laughed mid-sentence, or stared too long at the word "yacht" wondering where the letters went wrong.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>This poem was born from a war I fight that no one else sees.</em> <br>
<!-- -->It is about weed, yes. <br>
<!-- -->But more than that, it's about the slow unraveling of life when an escape becomes routine, and routine becomes a prison. <br>
<!-- -->It's about being surrounded by smoke. Not just in the air but in the mind, the mirror, and all the moments that matter.</p>
<p>This is me. Trying, failing, and trying again. <br>
<!-- -->I choose to keep trying cause when there is peace and clarity I remember what it's like to be me. <br>
<!-- -->I remember who I am when I'm free. <br>
<!-- -->I miss that man. <br>
<!-- -->So I wrote this to bring him back, and keep him around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->I wear the weight of smoke like skin. <br>
<!-- -->My body moves, but nothing's free.</p>
<p>I hear my friends light up again <br>
<!-- -->Discord, glowing in the dark. <br>
<!-- -->They're laughing. I'm pretending. <br>
<!-- -->I'm there, but I'm not.</p>
<p>No one says the words, <br>
<!-- -->But the silence carries pressure. <br>
<!-- -->Not joining feels like judgement. <br>
<!-- -->So I inhale the easy answer. <br>
<!-- -->And I vanish.</p>
<p><em>When I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->I forget what joy looks like <br>
<!-- -->without the blur.</p>
<p>I tell myself it's just to rest, <br>
<!-- -->to take the edge off. <br>
<!-- -->But the truth is— <br>
<!-- -->I get high to run <br>
<!-- -->from the man I'm afraid I'll never become.</p>
<p>Then come the hours I can't explain. <br>
<!-- -->The aching teeth. The throbbing skull. <br>
<!-- -->The to-do list bleeding into tomorrow.</p>
<p>Anna walking in, <br>
<!-- -->her eyes bright, mine dulled. <br>
<!-- -->I freeze—<br>
<!-- -->full of shame and nothing done.</p>
<p><em>When I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->I speak slower. Move slower. <br>
<!-- -->Dream less. <br>
<!-- -->Snap more. <br>
<!-- -->I say things I don't mean <br>
<!-- -->to the ones who mean everything.</p>
<p><em>When I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->I become fog. <br>
<!-- -->I become friction. <br>
<!-- -->I become someone I wouldn't trust. <br>
<!-- -->I become someone I can't respect.</p>
<p>And yet... <br>
<!-- -->Sober me is still in here. <br>
<!-- -->Tapping on the glass. <br>
<!-- -->He remembers—</p>
<p>the mornings that shimmered, <br>
<!-- -->the mind that sparked, <br>
<!-- -->the spine that stood tall <br>
<!-- -->without chemical crutches.</p>
<p>He remembers laughter <br>
<!-- -->that didn't need smoke to lift. <br>
<!-- -->He remembers the art, the run, <br>
<!-- -->the damn joy of being awake and real.</p>
<p>I miss him.</p>
<p><em>When I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->But I have not given up <br>
<!-- -->on the man beneath the fog.</p>
<p>I will fall again. I know that now. <br>
<!-- -->But fall is not the end of climb. <br>
<!-- -->It's the cost of reaching.</p>
<p>One day, I will stand in the light <br>
<!-- -->with lungs that breathe only air, <br>
<!-- -->a heart that holds no haze, <br>
<!-- -->a mind that no longer flees, <br>
<!-- -->a soul that does not shrink.</p>
<p>And I'll whisper to the smoke— <br>
<strong>"You do not own me."</strong><br>
<!-- -->Not today. Not anymore.</p>
<p>I will look back at the haze, <br>
<!-- -->at the days I dissolved into smoke, <br>
<!-- -->and I will not flinch.</p>
<p>Because <em>when I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->but I remember who I was, <br>
<!-- -->and I am becoming who I'm meant to be.</p>
<p>And if I fall, I will rise. <br>
<!-- -->I will try again. <br>
<!-- -->Because the only thing I have to lose <br>
<!-- -->are the chains I never needed.</p>
<p>And I will lose them. <br>
<!-- -->Every last one. <br>
<!-- -->And I will be free.</p>

<p><em>Recovery isn't a ladder, but a spiral staircase without safety rails.</em> <br>
<!-- -->This poem is a reflection on the struggle of addiction, particularly to substances like weed. It captures the internal battle between the desire for escape and the longing for authenticity. <br>
<!-- -->The imagery of smoke is meant to serve as a metaphor for the haze that can cloud one's identity and relationships.
I meant to ultimately convey a message of hope and resilience, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness and the journey toward reclaiming my true self.</p>
<p>This poem isn't meant to be an ending, but a beginning and a vow. <br>
<!-- -->I hope to read and reflect on this in the future if I find myself beginning to slip into the haze again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emi is the kind of person who surprises you. Not because she changes, but because she finally lets you see what was always there. She's stepping into the light, joining communities she once only watched from afar, making a name for herself where she belongs.</p>
<p>She is quick-witted, impossibly funny, and—despite her best efforts—endearing when drunk.</p>
<p>A mix of warmth, mischief, and competitive fire.</p>
<p>She is still growing, still unfolding, still learning how to take up space. But make no mistake—Emi is already brilliant. Already strong. Already exactly who she's meant to be.</p>
<p>This is for her.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At first, a quiet seed, tucked away,
roots deep, waiting—
for sun, for space, for a breath of warmth
to say it's safe now.</p>
<p>Now? Now she grows.
Not all at once, not without hesitation,
but inch by inch, leaf by leaf,
stretching toward something brighter.</p>
<p>She builds worlds in pixels and light,
streams a voice that once hid in silence—
now filling rooms, filling screens,
finding people who see her, who stay.</p>
<p>In the game, she plays to win.
Fast hands, sharper mind—
you won't see it coming
until your health bar is gone.</p>
<p>Two wild dogs crash at her feet,
a blur of fur, teeth, and loyalty.
Like her, they are chaos wrapped in love.
Like her, they belong to no one but themselves.</p>
<p>And drunk, in a moment of perfect absurdity,
she pulls me in close—
and I brace for something profound,
something heartfelt, something new.</p>
<p>"James…" she breathes, eyes heavy-lidded,
"I fucking hate Muldrotha."</p>
<p>And I laugh, because this is Emi.
The fighter, the dreamer, the storm and the bloom.
Still learning, still growing, still stepping into herself.
But no longer afraid to take up space.</p>
<p>No longer afraid to be.</p>

<!-- -->until it stops.</p>
<p>His care isn't loud.<br>
<!-- -->It's not a solo.<br>
<!-- -->It's not the melody that turns heads.<br>
<!-- -->But it holds the whole damn song together.</p>
<p>His curiosity flickers—<br>
<!-- -->not aimless,<br>
<!-- -->but open.<br>
<!-- -->One day it's drums,<br>
<!-- -->the next, a new sourdough starter, <em>(it died)</em><br>
<!-- -->maybe chess? <em>(eh, too hard)</em><br>
<!-- -->He doesn't chase passions—<br>
<!-- -->he visits them,<br>
<!-- -->sits with them,<br>
<!-- -->sees what they have to teach.</p>
<p>And through it all,<br>
<!-- -->he remains steady—<br>
<!-- -->the quiet pulse beneath the noise,<br>
<!-- -->never demanding the spotlight,<br>
<!-- -->but holding the shape of the room.<br>
<!-- -->You don't always notice it.<br>
<!-- -->But without it,<br>
<!-- -->everything feels off.</p>
<p>He dreams of leaving the fluorescent flicker<br>
<!-- -->of corporate servers<br>
<!-- -->for the hiss of steamed milk,<br>
<!-- -->for mugs on butcher block woodgrain,<br>
<!-- -->for conversations that don't require VPNs<br>
<!-- -->and no tone deaf executives saying "let's circle back".</p>
<p>And one day, he will.<br>
<!-- -->We'll be there, filling the stools in his quiet shop,<br>

<p>He'll pass by, towel on shoulder,<br>
<!-- -->pretending he isn't listening—<br>
<!-- -->but we'll raise our mugs anyway.</p>
<p>To Greg—<br>
<!-- -->who kept us steady,<br>
<!-- -->who loved us without noise,<br>
<!-- -->who made space for us before we knew we needed it.</p>
<p>And now?<br>
<!-- -->It's our turn.<br>
<!-- -->To see him.<br>
<!-- -->To show up.<br>
<!-- -->To build the harmony<br>
<!-- -->around his beat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In every life, there exists someone who brings light by simply being. This poem is for Anna, whose nurturing spirit, resilience, and warmth have made a house into a home. Like a flower that draws strength from the sun yet remains delicate in its beauty, she embodies both tenderness and remarkable strength.</p>
<!-- -->
<blockquote>
<p>You bloom where the light kisses open spaces,<br>
<!-- -->where warmth lingers, and kindness takes root.<br>
<!-- -->The sun adores you; follows you,<br>
<!-- -->as if it knows you are made of the same gold.</p>
<p>Your eyes, brown earth laced with jade,<br>
<!-- -->shift with the seasons of light,<br>
<!-- -->deep as old forests,<br>
<!-- -->soft as new leaves in spring.</p>
<p>Your voice carries through the house,<br>
<!-- -->wrapping around me like morning sunrays,
even silence feels smaller when you're away.</p>
<p>You were built to nurture,<br>
<!-- -->not just in the way the world expects,<br>
<!-- -->but in the way only souls understand.<br>
<!-- -->If love had hands, they would be yours.<br>
<!-- -->If patience had a voice, it would sound like you.</p>
<p>I call you Flower,<br>
<!-- -->not because you are delicate;<br>
<!-- -->but because you are strong.<br>
<!-- -->You rise with the dawn,<br>
<!-- -->bend with the wind,<br>
<!-- -->and thrive in the light<br>
<!-- -->that so many struggle to find.</p>
<p>And when night falls,<br>
<!-- -->when the world cools and quiets,<br>
<!-- -->I find my warmth in you.<br>
<!-- -->Rooted beside me,<br>
<!-- -->soft and steady,<br>
<!-- -->a garden of home in my arms.</p>

<p>I wrote this poem during a moment of appreciation for how certain people in our lives become foundations - not through grand gestures, but through consistent presence. The flower metaphor speaks to strength in gentleness, to beauty with purpose, to the kind of love that nourishes rather than consumes.</p>
<p>Like all poetry, it's personal, but I hope it resonates with anyone who has found that person who makes anywhere feel like home simply by being there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>So your fancy Anova Precision Oven suddenly has a dead display? Before you shell out $600+ for a replacement, there's a good chance you can fix it yourself with basic tools and about 30 minutes of your time!</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem">The Problem<a href="https://leshicodes.github.io/blog/anova-precision-oven-display-repair#the-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Problem" title="Direct link to The Problem">​</a></h2>
<p>The Anova Precision Oven has a common design flaw where the wires connecting to the display can become severed during normal use. This typically happens after opening and closing the door repeatedly over time. When these wires break, your display goes completely dark, making the oven unusable.
I faced this exact issue after about 18 months of ownership. Instead of trashing an otherwise perfect appliance, I decided to investigate - and the fix turned out to be surprisingly simple!</p>

<ul>
<li>Phillips screwdriver</li>
<li>Plastic spudger tool and/or flat-head screwdriver</li>
<li>Soldering iron and solder</li>
<li>Heat shrink tubing</li>
<li>Heat-resistant electrical tape</li>
<li><em>Alligator clips (optional, for testing)</em></li>
<li><em>String or cord (optional, to keep the door open during repair)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I know electrical repairs can seem intimidating if you've never done them before. I was hesitant too! But this is genuinely one of the simplest electrical fixes you can perform. The wires are low voltage, well-isolated, and easy to access.
If you can plug in a toaster and operate a screwdriver, you can absolutely handle this repair. That said, if you're truly uncomfortable, taking it to a repair shop is still vastly cheaper than replacement. Especially if you provide this guide!</p>

<p>Every engineer begins their journey with passion and excitement. We dream of building, creating, solving puzzles that matter. The technical challenges energize us; the elegance of well-crafted solutions fulfills us.</p>
<p>But as years pass, something changes. The bureaucracy grows. Meetings multiply. Documentation outweighs development. And somewhere along the way, that spark—that pure joy of building—begins to dim beneath the weight of corporate machinery.</p>
<p>This poem captures that journey: from wide-eyed optimism to the weary reality that many of us face in the modern tech landscape.</p>

<!-- -->A future forged with lines hard spun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The early days—when every project felt like changing the world. When learning was constant and possibilities were endless.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But oh, the climb—how steep it grew,<br>
<!-- -->Each year, more weight, more tasks to do.<br>
<!-- -->More forms to fill, more calls to take,<br>
<!-- -->Less time to build, more rules to break.</p>
<p>The meetings swelled, the memos flew,<br>
<!-- -->Decisions made by those who knew<br>
<!-- -->Not of the toil, nor of the strain;<br>
<!-- -->Just numbers tallied, loss and gain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>As responsibility grows, so do the administrative burdens. The ratio shifts: less making, more managing.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They say we must be agile... lean,<br>
<!-- -->Yet meetings swell where work had been.<br>
<!-- -->A hundred voices, none that hear,<br>
<!-- -->A sea of words, vague and unclear.</p>
<p>We talk of flow, efficiency,<br>
<!-- -->Yet drown in waves of policy.<br>
<!-- -->To save a dime, they waste a day,<br>
<!-- -->And call it growth as spirits fray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The irony of modern software development—we preach lean processes while bloating calendars. We talk about developer experience while engineers drown in process.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My hands once built, now push reports,<br>
<!-- -->My mind once soared, now twists through courts<br>
<!-- -->Of endless rules that shift like sand;<br>
<!-- -->No steady ground, no guiding hand.</p>
<p>The leaders speak of vision grand,<br>
<!-- -->Yet fail to see what's in their hand.<br>
<!-- -->The minds that built, now dulled by chains,<br>
<!-- -->The dreamers lost, the spark remains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The quiet tragedy: brilliant technical minds redirected to bureaucratic tasks. Innovation stifled by standardization. Creativity sacrificed for compliance.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So here I stand, a weary ghost,<br>
<!-- -->A coder lost at meetings coast.<br>
<!-- -->The thing I loved now wears me thin,<br>
<!-- -->Yet still, I stay, though worn within.</p>
<p>For in the cracks, the embers glow,<br>
<!-- -->The love remains, though buried low.<br>
<!-- -->And maybe yet, through toil and strain,<br>
<!-- -->The joy of building comes again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Despite it all, we persist. Because beneath the frustration, that love of creation remains. The hope that we'll find our way back to what matters.</em></p>

<p>I wrote this during a particularly bureaucratic day in my engineering career. It represents not just my experience, but a pattern I've witnessed across the industry—the gradual transformation of technical roles into administrative ones, and the toll it takes on those who entered the field with dreams of building.</p>
<p>Yet there's optimism in the final stanza. For all its challenges, software engineering remains a field of possibility. We find ways to reclaim our craft: through side projects, through mentoring, through refactoring neglected systems. We find pockets of joy in the work that reminds us why we started.</p>
<p>The lament isn't an ending—it's a reminder to fight for what drew us here in the first place.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Before we begin this epic ballad, a quick introduction to our protagonists:</p>
<p><strong>Stinker Bell</strong> (a.k.a. Stink Rat) - My clever, slightly murderous cat who dreams of outdoor adventures and bird hunting.</p>
<p><strong>Meat Head</strong> (a.k.a. Duke, Lugnut, the Nasty) - My lovable, not-so-bright hound who has never met a smell he didn't want to roll in or a disgusting thing he wouldn't eat.</p>

<p>This ballad was inspired by real events. My partner and I have caught these two partners-in-crime plotting escapes numerous times. Their unlikely friendship - the calculating cat and the himbo hound - continues to bring chaos and joy to our home.</p>
<p>Despite their different approaches to life (murder vs. eating garbage), they share a special bond. When no one is looking, you might catch them cuddling or grooming each other, though both would deny it if confronted.</p>
<p>As I write this, Stinker is napping while Meat Head snores on the couch, likely dreaming of their next great escape.</p>
<p>Seven, my chaotic pets. Seven.</p>]]></content:encoded>
