# Greg: Unseen, Essential

{/* Greg is the kind of friend you don't have to wonder about. He's there—always, without question. Not loud, not demanding, but constant. The kind of steady presence that makes life feel just a little more grounded.

He won't always say how much he cares, but he doesn't need to. It's in the small things—the way he checks in, the way he shows up, the way he keeps track of what matters to the people he loves.

His mind moves fast, hopping from one passion to the next, but there are a few things that never change. Louise, his best girl. Coffee, his quiet dream. And us, his friends, who know—without a doubt—just how lucky we are to have him.

This is for Greg. */}

## Greg: Unseen, Essential

> Coffee's on. *(Dark roast. Maybe a splash of oat milk.)*\
> Louise is fed. *(Good girl. Best Girl. Deserves the world)*\
> Teams pings in the background. *(He goes on DnD.)*
>
> Somewhere beneath it all,\
> Greg hums—low and steady,\
> the bassline in a jazz band,\
> easy to miss\
> until it stops.
>
> His care isn't loud.\
> It's not a solo.\
> It's not the melody that turns heads.\
> But it holds the whole damn song together.
>
> His curiosity flickers—\
> not aimless,\
> but open.\
> One day it's drums,\
> the next, a new sourdough starter, *(it died)*\
> maybe chess? *(eh, too hard)*\
> He doesn't chase passions—\
> he visits them,\
> sits with them,\
> sees what they have to teach.
>
> And through it all,\
> he remains steady—\
> the quiet pulse beneath the noise,\
> never demanding the spotlight,\
> but holding the shape of the room.\
> You don't always notice it.\
> But without it,\
> everything feels off.
>
> He dreams of leaving the fluorescent flicker\
> of corporate servers\
> for the hiss of steamed milk,\
> for mugs on butcher block woodgrain,\
> for conversations that don't require VPNs\
> and no tone deaf executives saying "let's circle back".
>
> And one day, he will.\
> We'll be there, filling the stools in his quiet shop,\
> cups in hand,\
> murmurs and laughter tangled in the scent of beans.
>
> He'll pass by, towel on shoulder,\
> pretending he isn't listening—\
> but we'll raise our mugs anyway.
>
> To Greg—\
> who kept us steady,\
> who loved us without noise,\
> who made space for us before we knew we needed it.
>
> And now?\
> It's our turn.\
> To see him.\
> To show up.\
> To build the harmony\
> around his beat.

{/* Coffee's brewing. (Dark roast. Maybe light? No—dark.)
Louise is fed. (Good girl. Best girl.)
Emails piling. (Ignore.)
Friends? Good. Safe? Probably.
Should check. Will check. Checks.

Mind like a pinball machine—
New hobbies? Too many.
Guitar? Fun. Chess? Hard.
Sourdough starter? Dead.
Onto the next.

But coffee—coffee stays.
Something about the warmth, the ritual, the way
it makes sense when nothing else does.
A shop, maybe. A small one. A quiet one.
No servers. No IT tickets. No deadlines.
Just steam, and the hum of a dream.

He won't say it, but we know:
Greg cares in the way he shows up.
In the way he remembers.
In the way he'd drop everything—without question, without pause—
Just to make sure we're okay.

A friend, a rock, a quiet kind of love.
The group's anchor. The group's dad.
And maybe, someday, the best damn barista this town has ever seen. */}

Notes

Greg is an awesome friend.
He's always puts his friends friends in high regard. Often times above himself, which can be a folly.
He cares deeply about people, even if he doesn't express it.
His interests change with the wind.
He is quiet and lovable.
Loves coffee, and wants to desperately drop his job in IT at Panera corporate to open a coffee shop (yearns for the simple life). 
Provides the best life for his beloved dog Louise, whom I love as my own. 
Is very much like a group dad. 

I have owed him ~800 bucks for over a year, and he never reached out once. Of course he trusts me, which by its self is a gift, but his patience is admirable.

Prehaps we can draw a metaphor to his friendship to a Bass Guitar or in a Jazz band? Like a steady beat, always there, but not always in the spotlight and we'd be lost without it. Wouldnt be complete.
