# Emi, Blooming

Emi is the kind of person who surprises you. Not because she changes, but because she finally lets you see what was always there. She's stepping into the light, joining communities she once only watched from afar, making a name for herself where she belongs.

She is quick-witted, impossibly funny, and—despite her best efforts—endearing when drunk. She once pulled me in like she had something deeply profound to say, something that would crack open the universe itself.

Instead, she whispered, "James… I fucking hate Muldrotha."

And honestly? That moment is Emi in a nutshell. A mix of warmth, mischief, and competitive fire.

She is still growing, still unfolding, still learning how to take up space. But make no mistake—Emi is already brilliant. Already strong. Already exactly who she's meant to be.

This is for her.

## Emi, Blooming

> At first, a quiet seed, tucked away,
> roots deep, waiting—
> for sun, for space, for a breath of warmth
> to say it's safe now.
>
> Now? Now she grows.
> Not all at once, not without hesitation,
> but inch by inch, leaf by leaf,
> stretching toward something brighter.
>
> She builds worlds in pixels and light,
> streams a voice that once hid in silence—
> now filling rooms, filling screens,
> finding people who see her, who stay.
>
> In the game, she plays to win.
> Fast hands, sharper mind—
> you won't see it coming
> until your health bar is gone.
>
> Two wild dogs crash at her feet,
> a blur of fur, teeth, and loyalty.
> Like her, they are chaos wrapped in love.
> Like her, they belong to no one but themselves.
>
> And drunk, in a moment of perfect absurdity,
> she pulls me in close—
> and I brace for something profound,
> something heartfelt, something new.
>
> "James…" she breathes, eyes heavy-lidded,
> "I fucking hate Muldrotha."
>
> And I laugh, because this is Emi.
> The fighter, the dreamer, the storm and the bloom.
> Still learning, still growing, still stepping into herself.
> But no longer afraid to take up space.
>
> No longer afraid to be.
