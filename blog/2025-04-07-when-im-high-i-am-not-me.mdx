# When I'm High, I am not me

### Preface
*This poem was born from a war I fight that no one else sees.* \
It is about weed, yes. \
But more than that, it's about the slow unraveling of life when an escape becomes routine, and routine becomes a prison. \
It's about being surrounded by smoke. Not just in the air but in the mind, the mirror, and all the moments that matter.

This is me. Trying, failing, and trying again. \
I choose to keep trying cause when there is peace and clarity I remember what it's like to be me. \
I remember who I am when I'm free. \
I miss that man. \
So I wrote this to bring him back, and keep him around.

### When I'm High, I am not me

> *When I'm high, I am not me.* \
> I wear the weight of smoke like skin. \
> My body moves, but nothing's free.
>
> I hear my friends light up again \
> Discord, glowing in the dark. \
> They're laughing. I'm pretending. \
> I'm there, but I'm not.
>
> No one says the words, \
> But the silence carries pressure. \
> Not joining feels like judgement. \
> So I inhale the easy answer. \
> And I vanish.
>
> *When I'm high, I am not me.* \
> I forget what joy looks like \
> without the blur.
>
> I tell myself it's just to rest, \
> to take the edge off. \
> But the truth is— \
> I get high to run \
> from the man I'm afraid I'll never become.
>
> Then come the hours I can't explain. \
> The aching teeth. The throbbing skull. \
> The to-do list bleeding into tomorrow.
>
> Anna walking in, \
> her eyes bright, mine dulled. \
> I freeze—\
> full of shame and nothing done.
>
> *When I'm high, I am not me.* \
> I speak slower. Move slower. \
> Dream less. \
> Snap more. \
> I say things I don't mean \
> to the ones who mean everything.
>
> *When I'm high, I am not me.* \
> I become fog. \
> I become friction. \
> I become someone I wouldn't trust. \
> I become someone I can't respect.
>
> And yet... \
> Sober me is still in here. \
> Tapping on the glass. \
> He remembers—
>
> the mornings that shimmered, \
> the mind that sparked, \
> the spine that stood tall \
> without chemical crutches.
>
> He remembers laughter \
> that didn't need smoke to lift. \
> He remembers the art, the run, \
> the damn joy of being awake and real.
>
> I miss him.
>
> *When I'm high, I am not me.* \
> But I have not given up \
> on the man beneath the fog.
>
> I will fall again. I know that now. \
> But fall is not the end of climb. \
> It's the cost of reaching.
>
> One day, I will stand in the light \
> with lungs that breathe only air, \
> a heart that holds no haze, \
> a mind that no longer flees, \
> a soul that does not shrink.
>
> And I'll whisper to the smoke— \
> **"You do not own me."**\
> Not today. Not anymore.
>
> I will look back at the haze, \
> at the days I dissolved into smoke, \
> and I will not flinch.
>
> Because *when I'm high, I am not me.* \
> but I remember who I was, \
> and I am becoming who I'm meant to be.
>
> And if I fall, I will rise. \
> I will try again. \
> Because the only thing I have to lose \
> are the chains I never needed.
>
> And I will lose them. \
> Every last one. \
> And I will be free.

### Reflections
*Recovery isn't a ladder, but a spiral staircase without safety rails.* \
This poem is a reflection on the struggle of addiction, particularly to substances like weed. It captures the internal battle between the desire for escape and the longing for authenticity. \
The imagery of smoke is meant to serve as a metaphor for the haze that can cloud one's identity and relationships. 
I meant to ultimately convey a message of hope and resilience, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness and the journey toward reclaiming my true self.

This poem isn't meant to be an ending, but a beginning and a vow. \
I hope to read and reflect on this in the future if I find myself beginning to slip into the haze again.
