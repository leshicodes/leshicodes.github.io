<p><em>This poem was born from a war I fight that no one else sees.</em> <br>
<!-- -->It is about weed, yes. <br>
<!-- -->But more than that, it's about the slow unraveling of life when an escape becomes routine, and routine becomes a prison. <br>
<!-- -->It's about being surrounded by smoke. Not just in the air but in the mind, the mirror, and all the moments that matter.</p>
<p>This is me. Trying, failing, and trying again. <br>
<!-- -->I choose to keep trying cause when there is peace and clarity I remember what it's like to be me. <br>
<!-- -->I remember who I am when I'm free. <br>
<!-- -->I miss that man. <br>
<!-- -->So I wrote this to bring him back, and keep him around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->I wear the weight of smoke like skin. <br>
<!-- -->My body moves, but nothing's free.</p>
<p>I hear my friends light up again <br>
<!-- -->Discord, glowing in the dark. <br>
<!-- -->They're laughing. I'm pretending. <br>
<!-- -->I'm there, but I'm not.</p>
<p>No one says the words, <br>
<!-- -->But the silence carries pressure. <br>
<!-- -->Not joining feels like judgement. <br>
<!-- -->So I inhale the easy answer. <br>
<!-- -->And I vanish.</p>
<p><em>When I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->I forget what joy looks like <br>
<!-- -->without the blur.</p>
<p>I tell myself it's just to rest, <br>
<!-- -->to take the edge off. <br>
<!-- -->But the truth is— <br>
<!-- -->I get high to run <br>
<!-- -->from the man I'm afraid I'll never become.</p>
<p>Then come the hours I can't explain. <br>
<!-- -->The aching teeth. The throbbing skull. <br>
<!-- -->The to-do list bleeding into tomorrow.</p>
<p>Anna walking in, <br>
<!-- -->her eyes bright, mine dulled. <br>
<!-- -->I freeze—<br>
<!-- -->full of shame and nothing done.</p>
<p><em>When I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->I speak slower. Move slower. <br>
<!-- -->Dream less. <br>
<!-- -->Snap more. <br>
<!-- -->I say things I don't mean <br>
<!-- -->to the ones who mean everything.</p>
<p><em>When I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->I become fog. <br>
<!-- -->I become friction. <br>
<!-- -->I become someone I wouldn't trust. <br>
<!-- -->I become someone I can't respect.</p>
<p>And yet... <br>
<!-- -->Sober me is still in here. <br>
<!-- -->Tapping on the glass. <br>
<!-- -->He remembers—</p>
<p>the mornings that shimmered, <br>
<!-- -->the mind that sparked, <br>
<!-- -->the spine that stood tall <br>
<!-- -->without chemical crutches.</p>
<p>He remembers laughter <br>
<!-- -->that didn't need smoke to lift. <br>
<!-- -->He remembers the art, the run, <br>
<!-- -->the damn joy of being awake and real.</p>
<p>I miss him.</p>
<p><em>When I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->But I have not given up <br>
<!-- -->on the man beneath the fog.</p>
<p>I will fall again. I know that now. <br>
<!-- -->But fall is not the end of climb. <br>
<!-- -->It's the cost of reaching.</p>
<p>One day, I will stand in the light <br>
<!-- -->with lungs that breathe only air, <br>
<!-- -->a heart that holds no haze, <br>
<!-- -->a mind that no longer flees, <br>
<!-- -->a soul that does not shrink.</p>
<p>And I'll whisper to the smoke— <br>
<strong>"You do not own me."</strong><br>
<!-- -->Not today. Not anymore.</p>
<p>I will look back at the haze, <br>
<!-- -->at the days I dissolved into smoke, <br>
<!-- -->and I will not flinch.</p>
<p>Because <em>when I'm high, I am not me.</em> <br>
<!-- -->but I remember who I was, <br>
<!-- -->and I am becoming who I'm meant to be.</p>
<p>And if I fall, I will rise. <br>
<!-- -->I will try again. <br>
<!-- -->Because the only thing I have to lose <br>
<!-- -->are the chains I never needed.</p>
<p>And I will lose them. <br>
<!-- -->Every last one. <br>
<!-- -->And I will be free.</p>

<p><em>Recovery isn't a ladder, but a spiral staircase without safety rails.</em> <br>
<!-- -->This poem is a reflection on the struggle of addiction, particularly to substances like weed. It captures the internal battle between the desire for escape and the longing for authenticity. <br>
<!-- -->The imagery of smoke is meant to serve as a metaphor for the haze that can cloud one's identity and relationships.
I meant to ultimately convey a message of hope and resilience, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness and the journey toward reclaiming my true self.</p>
<p>This poem isn't meant to be an ending, but a beginning and a vow. <br>
<!-- -->I hope to read and reflect on this in the future if I find myself beginning to slip into the haze again.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Emi is the kind of person who surprises you. Not because she changes, but because she finally lets you see what was always there. She's stepping into the light, joining communities she once only watched from afar, making a name for herself where she belongs.</p>
<p>She is quick-witted, impossibly funny, and—despite her best efforts—endearing when drunk.</p>
<p>A mix of warmth, mischief, and competitive fire.</p>
<p>She is still growing, still unfolding, still learning how to take up space. But make no mistake—Emi is already brilliant. Already strong. Already exactly who she's meant to be.</p>
<p>This is for her.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At first, a quiet seed, tucked away,
roots deep, waiting—
for sun, for space, for a breath of warmth
to say it's safe now.</p>
<p>Now? Now she grows.
Not all at once, not without hesitation,
but inch by inch, leaf by leaf,
stretching toward something brighter.</p>
<p>She builds worlds in pixels and light,
streams a voice that once hid in silence—
now filling rooms, filling screens,
finding people who see her, who stay.</p>
<p>In the game, she plays to win.
Fast hands, sharper mind—
you won't see it coming
until your health bar is gone.</p>
<p>Two wild dogs crash at her feet,
a blur of fur, teeth, and loyalty.
Like her, they are chaos wrapped in love.
Like her, they belong to no one but themselves.</p>
<p>And drunk, in a moment of perfect absurdity,
she pulls me in close—
and I brace for something profound,
something heartfelt, something new.</p>
<p>"James…" she breathes, eyes heavy-lidded,
"I fucking hate Muldrotha."</p>
<p>And I laugh, because this is Emi.
The fighter, the dreamer, the storm and the bloom.
Still learning, still growing, still stepping into herself.
But no longer afraid to take up space.</p>
<p>No longer afraid to be.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Greg is the kind of friend you don’t have to wonder about. He’s there—always, without question. Not loud, not demanding, but constant. The kind of steady presence that makes life feel just a little more grounded.</p>
<p>He won’t always say how much he cares, but he doesn’t need to. It’s in the small things—the way he checks in, the way he shows up, the way he keeps track of what matters to the people he loves.</p>
<p>His mind moves fast, hopping from one passion to the next, but there are a few things that never change. Louise, his best girl. Coffee, his quiet dream. And us, his friends, who know—without a doubt—just how lucky we are to have him.</p>
<p>This is for Greg.</p>

<p>Coffee’s brewing. (Dark roast. Maybe light? No—dark.)
Louise is fed. (Good girl. Best girl.)
Emails piling. (Ignore.)
Friends? Good. Safe? Probably.
Should check. Will check. Checks.</p>
<p>Mind like a pinball machine—
New hobbies? Too many.
Guitar? Fun. Chess? Hard.
Sourdough starter? Dead.
Onto the next.</p>
<p>But coffee—coffee stays.
Something about the warmth, the ritual, the way
it makes sense when nothing else does.
A shop, maybe. A small one. A quiet one.
No servers. No IT tickets. No deadlines.
Just steam, and the hum of a dream.</p>
<p>He won’t say it, but we know:
Greg cares in the way he shows up.
In the way he remembers.
In the way he’d drop everything—without question, without pause—
Just to make sure we’re okay.</p>
<p>A friend, a rock, a quiet kind of love.
The group’s anchor. The group’s dad.
And maybe, someday, the best damn barista this town has ever seen.</p>]]></content>

<p>You bloom where the light kisses open spaces,<br>

<p>Your eyes, brown earth laced with jade,<br>

<p>And when night falls,<br>

<p>I wrote this poem during a moment of appreciation for how certain people in our lives become foundations - not through grand gestures, but through consistent presence. The flower metaphor speaks to strength in gentleness, to beauty with purpose, to the kind of love that nourishes rather than consumes.</p>
<p>Like all poetry, it's personal, but I hope it resonates with anyone who has found that person who makes anywhere feel like home simply by being there.</p>]]></content>

<p>So your fancy Anova Precision Oven suddenly has a dead display? Before you shell out $600+ for a replacement, there's a good chance you can fix it yourself with basic tools and about 30 minutes of your time!</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem">The Problem<a href="https://leshicodes.github.io/blog/anova-precision-oven-display-repair#the-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Problem" title="Direct link to The Problem">​</a></h2>
<p>The Anova Precision Oven has a common design flaw where the wires connecting to the display can become severed during normal use. This typically happens after opening and closing the door repeatedly over time. When these wires break, your display goes completely dark, making the oven unusable.
I faced this exact issue after about 18 months of ownership. Instead of trashing an otherwise perfect appliance, I decided to investigate - and the fix turned out to be surprisingly simple!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-youll-need">What You'll Need<a href="https://leshicodes.github.io/blog/anova-precision-oven-display-repair#what-youll-need" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What You'll Need" title="Direct link to What You'll Need">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Phillips screwdriver</li>
<li>Plastic spudger tool and/or flat-head screwdriver</li>
<li>Soldering iron and solder</li>
<li>Heat shrink tubing</li>
<li>Heat-resistant electrical tape</li>
<li><em>Alligator clips (optional, for testing)</em></li>
<li><em>String or cord (optional, to keep the door open during repair)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I know electrical repairs can seem intimidating if you've never done them before. I was hesitant too! But this is genuinely one of the simplest electrical fixes you can perform. The wires are low voltage, well-isolated, and easy to access.
If you can plug in a toaster and operate a screwdriver, you can absolutely handle this repair. That said, if you're truly uncomfortable, taking it to a repair shop is still vastly cheaper than replacement. Especially if you provide this guide!</p>

<p>Every engineer begins their journey with passion and excitement. We dream of building, creating, solving puzzles that matter. The technical challenges energize us; the elegance of well-crafted solutions fulfills us.</p>
<p>But as years pass, something changes. The bureaucracy grows. Meetings multiply. Documentation outweighs development. And somewhere along the way, that spark—that pure joy of building—begins to dim beneath the weight of corporate machinery.</p>
<p>This poem captures that journey: from wide-eyed optimism to the weary reality that many of us face in the modern tech landscape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I walked in young, my heart alight,<br>
<!-- -->With code and dreams that burned so bright.<br>
<!-- -->Each line I wrote, a stroke of art,<br>
<!-- -->Each problem solved, a work of heart.</p>
<p>The world of tech, a boundless sea,<br>
<!-- -->A place where thought and hands ran free.<br>
<!-- -->We built, we shaped, we stood as one,<br>
<!-- -->A future forged with lines hard spun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The early days—when every project felt like changing the world. When learning was constant and possibilities were endless.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But oh, the climb—how steep it grew,<br>
<!-- -->Each year, more weight, more tasks to do.<br>
<!-- -->More forms to fill, more calls to take,<br>
<!-- -->Less time to build, more rules to break.</p>
<p>The meetings swelled, the memos flew,<br>
<!-- -->Decisions made by those who knew<br>
<!-- -->Not of the toil, nor of the strain;<br>
<!-- -->Just numbers tallied, loss and gain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>As responsibility grows, so do the administrative burdens. The ratio shifts: less making, more managing.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They say we must be agile... lean,<br>
<!-- -->Yet meetings swell where work had been.<br>
<!-- -->A hundred voices, none that hear,<br>
<!-- -->A sea of words, vague and unclear.</p>
<p>We talk of flow, efficiency,<br>
<!-- -->Yet drown in waves of policy.<br>
<!-- -->To save a dime, they waste a day,<br>
<!-- -->And call it growth as spirits fray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The irony of modern software development—we preach lean processes while bloating calendars. We talk about developer experience while engineers drown in process.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My hands once built, now push reports,<br>
<!-- -->My mind once soared, now twists through courts<br>
<!-- -->Of endless rules that shift like sand;<br>
<!-- -->No steady ground, no guiding hand.</p>
<p>The leaders speak of vision grand,<br>
<!-- -->Yet fail to see what's in their hand.<br>
<!-- -->The minds that built, now dulled by chains,<br>
<!-- -->The dreamers lost, the spark remains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The quiet tragedy: brilliant technical minds redirected to bureaucratic tasks. Innovation stifled by standardization. Creativity sacrificed for compliance.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So here I stand, a weary ghost,<br>
<!-- -->A coder lost at meetings coast.<br>
<!-- -->The thing I loved now wears me thin,<br>
<!-- -->Yet still, I stay, though worn within.</p>
<p>For in the cracks, the embers glow,<br>
<!-- -->The love remains, though buried low.<br>
<!-- -->And maybe yet, through toil and strain,<br>
<!-- -->The joy of building comes again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Despite it all, we persist. Because beneath the frustration, that love of creation remains. The hope that we'll find our way back to what matters.</em></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="afterword">Afterword<a href="https://leshicodes.github.io/blog/engineers-lament#afterword" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Afterword" title="Direct link to Afterword">​</a></h2>
<p>I wrote this during a particularly bureaucratic day in my engineering career. It represents not just my experience, but a pattern I've witnessed across the industry—the gradual transformation of technical roles into administrative ones, and the toll it takes on those who entered the field with dreams of building.</p>
<p>Yet there's optimism in the final stanza. For all its challenges, software engineering remains a field of possibility. We find ways to reclaim our craft: through side projects, through mentoring, through refactoring neglected systems. We find pockets of joy in the work that reminds us why we started.</p>
<p>The lament isn't an ending—it's a reminder to fight for what drew us here in the first place.</p>]]></content>

<p><strong>Stinker Bell</strong> (a.k.a. Stink Rat) - My clever, slightly murderous cat who dreams of outdoor adventures and bird hunting.</p>
<p><strong>Meat Head</strong> (a.k.a. Duke, Lugnut, the Nasty) - My lovable, not-so-bright hound who has never met a smell he didn't want to roll in or a disgusting thing he wouldn't eat.</p>

<p>This ballad was inspired by real events. My partner and I have caught these two partners-in-crime plotting escapes numerous times. Their unlikely friendship - the calculating cat and the himbo hound - continues to bring chaos and joy to our home.</p>
<p>Despite their different approaches to life (murder vs. eating garbage), they share a special bond. When no one is looking, you might catch them cuddling or grooming each other, though both would deny it if confronted.</p>
<p>As I write this, Stinker is napping while Meat Head snores on the couch, likely dreaming of their next great escape.</p>
<p>Seven, my chaotic pets. Seven.</p>]]></content>
