# The Wheel

Preface?

{/* truncate */}

> The earth was broken long ago,  
> Before we knew its name.  
> They carved the clouds into a brand,  
> Then sold us skies of flame.
>
> And still, the wheel turns round,  
> Grinding bone and soil and sound.  
> We cry, we bleed, we till the ground  
> And still, the wheel turns round.
>
> The healer's door is locked and cold,  
> Its key a price too steep.  
> The sick are told to wait in line—  
> Or pay, or pray, or weep.
>
> And still, the wheel turns round,  
> Grinding bone and soil and sound.  
> We cry, we bleed, we till the ground—  
> And still, the wheel turns round.
>
> The food is fake, the rent is real,  
> The clocks all run in debt.  
> We sell our breath to buy the means  
> To sleep, forget, and sweat.
>
> And still, the wheel turns round,  
> Grinding bone and soil and sound.  
> We cry, we bleed, we till the ground—  
> And still, the wheel turns round.
>
> The children learn to count in scars,  
> The newsmen sell us blame.  
> We know the world is burning down,  
> But never name the flame.
>
> And still, the wheel turns round,  
> Grinding bone and soil and sound.  
> We cry, we bleed, we till the ground—  
> And still, the wheel turns round.
>
> We are the cogs beneath the wheel,  
> Our breath the grease that keeps it fed.  
> It grinds us down, then pays in crumbs—  
> Just enough to fear the dead.
>
> It turns, it turns, it always has  
> But every wheel runs thin.  
> And one day soon, the steel will slip  
> And let the fire in.

{/* But under ash, the seed remains.
The soil still knows our sound.
The wheel may turn, but hands can rise—
To slow it down. */}
