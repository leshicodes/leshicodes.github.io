# Nick: Two Layers Deep

> O Nick, brave bard of Baja Blast and burrito wrap,  
> Our pajama-jeaned jester, our laugh-track and gap  
> Burrito Baller turned Cloud Wrangler  
> From beef wraps to backend stacks, you pivoted with swagger.  
>
> You take the roast like a king on his throne,  
> Crowned in laughs, never standing alone.  
> *"Just a lil guy"* we say with a smirk,  
> But behind those wisecracks, there's a whole lotta work.
>
> We watched you stammer, charm folded in fumble,  
> As you asked for a "2 All Star Meal" and the cosmos crumbled.  
> She blinked. You beamed. I wheezed like a kettle  
> Moments like that? Pure comedic metal.
>
> But beneath the facade and Baja blast mist,  
> There's more to the man who we always missed  
> When he's not around, the humor, yes  
> But also that pulse of something less
>
> something deeper, like sky behind smog.  
> You left your job, and cleared the mental fog.  
> Not everyone has the guts to say,  
> "This thing that pays me? It chips me away."
>
> So you walked. Not away-but toward.  
> No confetti, no sword.  
> Just resolve in your voice, and hands that shook  
> Still, you turned the page. You rewrote the book.
>
> You're our comic relief and the stillness between,  
> The little brother wrapped in every scene.  
> Two layers of pants, two sides you defend  
> One for the laughs, one you're slow to lend.  
> But we see you, Nickâ€”not just what's shown,  
> The quiet you carry, the strength you've grown.
>
> So cheers, Nick. Our pajama knight,  
> Still funny as hell, still full of fight.  
> From burritos to backend, you've weathered the climb,  
> You're not just part of the joke; you're the punchline's spine.
>
> Here's to the courage you don't even boast,  
> To the friend who we razz, but who matters the most.  
>
> Nick, you're the proof that soft souls are tough,  
> And being real with yourself is more than enough.  
> You're comedy stitched with a thread of gold  
> The brother who's funny, and fierce, and bold.
