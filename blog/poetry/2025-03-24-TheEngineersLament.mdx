## The Engineer's Lament 

*I walked in young, my heart alight,
With code and dreams that burned so bright.
Each line I wrote, a stroke of art,
Each problem solved, a work of heart.*

*The world of tech, a boundless sea,
A place where thought and hands ran free.
We built, we shaped, we stood as one,
A future forged with lines hard spun.*

*But oh, the climbâ€”how steep it grew,
Each year, more weight, more tasks to do.
More forms to fill, more calls to take,
Less time to build, more rules to break.*

*The meetings swelled, the memos flew,
Decisions made by those who knew
Not of the toil, nor of the strain;
Just numbers tallied, loss and gain.*

*They say we must be agile ...lean,
Yet meetings swell where work had been.
A hundred voices, none that hear,
A sea of words, vague and unclear.*

*We talk of flow, efficiency,
Yet drown in waves of policy.
To save a dime, they waste a day,
And call it growth as spirits fray.*

*My hands once built, now push reports,
My mind once soared, now twists through courts
Of endless rules that shift like sand;
No steady ground, no guiding hand.*

*The leaders speak of vision grand,
Yet fail to see what's in their hand.
The minds that built, now dulled by chains,
The dreamers lost, the spark remains.*

*So here I stand, a weary ghost,
A coder lost at meetings coast.
The thing I loved now wears me thin,
Yet still, I stay, though worn within.*

*For in the cracks, the embers glow,
The love remains, though buried low.
And maybe yet, through toil and strain,
The joy of building comes again.*
