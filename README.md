# Personal Website - [leshicodes.github.io](https://leshicodes.github.io)

Welcome to my personal website, powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)! This site serves as a hub for my hobbies, projects, and documentation. It's hosted on GitHub Pages and built to showcase a variety of content, including:

- **Poetry**: A collection of my creative writing.
- **Home Improvement Projects**: Guides and documentation for DIY projects.
- **Open Source Projects**: Documentation and resources for my open-source contributions.
- **Private Jellyfin Server Docs**: Tutorials and guides for friends on how to use my private Jellyfin media server.

## Features

- **Docusaurus-Powered**: Built with Docusaurus, a modern static site generator.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable with React components and Markdown.
- **Multi-Purpose**: Supports blogs, documentation, and standalone pages.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
