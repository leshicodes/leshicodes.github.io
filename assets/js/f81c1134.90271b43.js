Before you shell out $600+ for a replacement, there\'s a good chance you can fix it yourself with basic tools and about 30 minutes of your time!\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## The Problem\\n\\nThe Anova Precision Oven has a common design flaw where the wires connecting to the display can become severed during normal use. This typically happens after opening and closing the door repeatedly over time. When these wires break, your display goes completely dark, making the oven unusable.\\nI faced this exact issue after about 18 months of ownership. Instead of trashing an otherwise perfect appliance, I decided to investigate - and the fix turned out to be surprisingly simple!\\n\\n## What You\'ll Need\\n\\n- Phillips screwdriver\\n- Plastic spudger tool and/or flat-head screwdriver\\n- Soldering iron and solder\\n- Heat shrink tubing\\n- Heat-resistant electrical tape\\n- *Alligator clips (optional, for testing)*\\n- *String or cord (optional, to keep the door open during repair)*\\n\\n## A Note of Encouragement\\nI know electrical repairs can seem intimidating if you\'ve never done them before. I was hesitant too! But this is genuinely one of the simplest electrical fixes you can perform. The wires are low voltage, well-isolated, and easy to access. \\nIf you can plug in a toaster and operate a screwdriver, you can absolutely handle this repair. That said, if you\'re truly uncomfortable, taking it to a repair shop is still vastly cheaper than replacement. Especially if you provide this guide!\\n\\n## The Repair Process\\n\\n### Step 1: Removing the Oven Door\'s Heat Shield \\n\\n1. **Open the oven door fully**. Locate and remove the 5 screws from the top side of the oven door.\\n\\n![AnovaPrecisionOven-ScrewLocations](./assets/APO-Screw-Locations.png)\\n\\n2. **Remove the top cover** of the oven door.\\n:::tip Pro Tip\\nThe top cover is held in place by friction. Use a flat head screwdriver or a [plastic spudger tool](https://www.amazon.com/plastic-spudger/s?k=plastic+spudger) to gently pry the top cover off. Work slowly around the edges to avoid cracking the plastic.\\n:::\\n\\n:::warning Door Hack\\n**IMPORTANT:** Tie down the door with something like I did below! Once the heat shield is removed, the door will constantly try to close on you, making repairs frustrating. A simple piece of string saves a lot of headaches.\\n![AnovaPrecisionOven-DoorTieDown](./assets/APO-DoorTieDown.jpeg)\\n:::\\n\\nHere\'s the spudger tool I used:\\n![AnovaPrecisionOven-spudger](./assets/APO-Spudger.jpeg)\\n\\nThe best places to begin prying are shown below:\\n![AnovaPrecisionOven-PryLocation1](./assets/APO-PryLocation1.jpeg)\\n![AnovaPrecisionOven-PryLocation2](./assets/APO-PryLocation2.jpeg)\\n\\n3. When properly removed, your door should look like this:\\n![AnovaPrecisionOven-HeatBrakeOff](./assets/APO-HeatBrakeOff.jpeg)\\n\\n### Step 2: Locating and Fixing the Severed Wires\\n:::tip Trust But Verify\\nBefore committing to soldering, I recommend testing the wires first! I connected alligator clips to each end of the severed wires (being careful not to short anything) to verify this was indeed the issue. When connected, my display immediately came to life once I plugged it in!\\n:::\\n\\n1. **Examine the bottom left corner** of the oven to find the wiring harness. You\'ll likely see a white plastic harness with severed wires. In my case, the brown and white wires were the culprits.\\n\\n![AnovaPrecisionOven-SeveredWires](./assets/APO-SeveredWires.jpeg)\\n\\n2. **Strip and solder** the wires back together. Protect your connections with heat shrink tubing and heat-rated electrical tape to prevent future shorts.\\n\\n:::tip Don\'t Fear Soldering!\\nI used the [Fanttik T1 Max Soldering Iron Kit](https://fanttik.com/products/fanttik-t1-max-soldering-iron-kit?_pos=1&_sid=ab707b9cf&_ss=r), but any basic soldering iron will work. This was only my second time soldering wires, and it was surprisingly easy! Just take your time and watch a quick YouTube tutorial if you\'re nervous.\\n:::\\n\\nHere\'s how my repair looked:\\n![AnovaPrecisionOven-FixedWires](./assets/APO-FixedWires.jpeg)\\n\\n### Step 3: Testing Your Repair\\n\\nThe moment of truth! Simply plug the oven back in and turn it on. If the display lights up, \\n**congratulations** you\'ve successfully fixed your oven!\\n\\n### Step 4: Reassembling the Oven Door\\n\\n1. Reverse the disassembly steps to put everything back together. **Don\'t forget to remove your door tie before closing it!**\\n\\n![AnovaPrecisionOven-Working](./assets/APO-Working.jpeg)\\n\\n2. **Congratulations!** You\'ve just saved yourself approximately $600 USD and kept a perfectly good appliance out of the landfill. Your wallet (and the environment) thank you!\\n\\n## Closing Thoughts\\n\\nThis repair highlights how many \\"broken\\" modern appliances can be fixed with simple DIY solutions. The Anova Precision Oven is an excellent product with this one design flaw, and now yours should provide many more years of perfectly cooked meals!\\n\\nHave you repaired other kitchen appliances?

We dream of building, creating, solving puzzles that matter. The technical challenges energize us; the elegance of well-crafted solutions fulfills us.\\n\\nBut as years pass, something changes. The bureaucracy grows. Meetings multiply. Documentation outweighs development. And somewhere along the way, that spark\u2014that pure joy of building\u2014begins to dim beneath the weight of corporate machinery.\\n\\nThis poem captures that journey: from wide-eyed optimism to the weary reality that many of us face in the modern tech landscape.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n## The Engineer\'s Lament\\n\\n> I walked in young, my heart alight,  \\n> With code and dreams that burned so bright.  \\n> Each line I wrote, a stroke of art,  \\n> Each problem solved, a work of heart.\\n>\\n> The world of tech, a boundless sea,  \\n> A place where thought and hands ran free.  \\n> We built, we shaped, we stood as one,  \\n> A future forged with lines hard spun.\\n\\n*The early days\u2014when every project felt like changing the world. When learning was constant and possibilities were endless.*\\n\\n> But oh, the climb\u2014how steep it grew,  \\n> Each year, more weight, more tasks to do.  \\n> More forms to fill, more calls to take,  \\n> Less time to build, more rules to break.\\n>\\n> The meetings swelled, the memos flew,  \\n> Decisions made by those who knew  \\n> Not of the toil, nor of the strain;  \\n> Just numbers tallied, loss and gain.\\n\\n*As responsibility grows, so do the administrative burdens. The ratio shifts: less making, more managing.*\\n\\n> They say we must be agile... lean,  \\n> Yet meetings swell where work had been.  \\n> A hundred voices, none that hear,  \\n> A sea of words, vague and unclear.\\n>\\n> We talk of flow, efficiency,  \\n> Yet drown in waves of policy.  \\n> To save a dime, they waste a day,  \\n> And call it growth as spirits fray.\\n\\n*The irony of modern software development\u2014we preach lean processes while bloating calendars. We talk about developer experience while engineers drown in process.*\\n\\n> My hands once built, now push reports,  \\n> My mind once soared, now twists through courts  \\n> Of endless rules that shift like sand;  \\n> No steady ground, no guiding hand.\\n>\\n> The leaders speak of vision grand,  \\n> Yet fail to see what\'s in their hand.  \\n> The minds that built, now dulled by chains,  \\n> The dreamers lost, the spark remains.\\n\\n*The quiet tragedy: brilliant technical minds redirected to bureaucratic tasks. Innovation stifled by standardization. Creativity sacrificed for compliance.*\\n\\n> So here I stand, a weary ghost,  \\n> A coder lost at meetings coast.  \\n> The thing I loved now wears me thin,  \\n> Yet still, I stay, though worn within.\\n>\\n> For in the cracks, the embers glow,  \\n> The love remains, though buried low.  \\n> And maybe yet, through toil and strain,  \\n> The joy of building comes again.\\n\\n*Despite it all, we persist. Because beneath the frustration, that love of creation remains. The hope that we\'ll find our way back to what matters.*\\n\\n## Afterword\\n\\nI wrote this during a particularly bureaucratic day in my engineering career. It represents not just my experience, but a pattern I\'ve witnessed across the industry\u2014the gradual transformation of technical roles into administrative ones, and the toll it takes on those who entered the field with dreams of building.\\n\\nYet there\'s optimism in the final stanza. For all its challenges, software engineering remains a field of possibility. We find ways to reclaim our craft: through side projects, through mentoring, through refactoring neglected systems. We find pockets of joy in the work that reminds us why we started.\\n\\nThe lament isn\'t an ending\u2014it\'s a reminder to fight for what drew us here in the first place."},{"id":"the-ballad-of-the-cat-and-hound","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-ballad-of-the-cat-and-hound","editUrl":"https://github.com/leshicodes/leshicodes.github.io/tree/main/blog/2024-02-18-the-ballad-of-the-cat-and-hound/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-18-the-ballad-of-the-cat-and-hound/index.mdx","title":"The Ballad of the Cat and the Hound","description":"A musical tale of mischief, adventure, and pet shenanigans","date":"2024-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"poetry","permalink":"/blog/tags/poetry","description":"poetry description (TODO)"},{"inline":true,"label":"pets","permalink":"/blog/tags/pets"},{"inline":true,"label":"humor","permalink":"/blog/tags/humor"},{"inline":true,"label":"personal","permalink":"/blog/tags/personal"}],"readingTime":3.81,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"James Ambrose","url":"https://github.com/leshicodes","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/james"},"description":"I\'m a software engineer who loves to write about programming, tech, and life.","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/leshicodes","bluesky":"https://bsky.app/profile/leshicodes.bsky.social","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjambrose/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/leshicodes.png","key":"james"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-ballad-of-the-cat-and-hound","title":"The Ballad of the Cat and the Hound","tags":["poetry","pets","humor","personal"],"authors":["james"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Engineer\'s Lament","permalink":"/blog/engineers-lament"}},"content":"> *A musical tale of mischief, adventure, and pet shenanigans*\\n\\n{/* TODO: ![Stinker Bell and Meat Head](./assets/pets.jpg)  */}\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nBefore we begin this epic ballad, a quick introduction to our protagonists:\\n\\n**Stinker Bell** (a.k.a.

That\'s vile, that\'s sick!\\"  \\n> But Duke only grinned and gave it a lick.  \\n> He danced and he pranced, a buffoon full of cheer,  \\n> While Stink Rat just gagged, regretting her peer.\\n\\n*[I cannot emphasize enough how accurately this portrays my dog\'s enthusiasm for eating shit.]*\\n\\n### Chorus\\n> \\"Seven,\\" he whispered, still licking his prize,  \\n> \\"Seven,\\" she groaned, rolling her eyes.  \\n> The hound and the cat, so different yet true,  \\n> A bond forged in chaos, for me and for you.\\n\\n### Outro\\n> But just as their journey was reaching its peak,  \\n> A door swung wide, and they both heard a shriek.  \\n> For standing right there with a furious sound,  \\n> Was their keeper, enraged, homeward-bound.\\n>\\n> Back through the door, they were tossed in a flurry,  \\n> Duke wagged his tail, while Stinker looked worried.  \\n> But locked up again, they still dreamed of the day,  \\n> When once more together\u2014they\'d sneak away.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Afterword\\n\\nThis ballad was inspired by real events. My partner and I have caught these two partners-in-crime plotting escapes numerous times. Their unlikely friendship - the calculating cat and the himbo hound - continues to bring chaos and joy to our home.\\n\\nDespite their different approaches to life (murder vs. eating garbage), they share a special bond. When no one is looking, you might catch them cuddling or grooming each other, though both would deny it if confronted.\\n\\nAs I write this, Stinker is napping while Meat Head snores on the couch, likely dreaming of their next great escape.\\n\\nSeven, my chaotic pets.
